This folder contains aggregated poms and Dockerfiles from the various workshops. These are not used _per se_ during the exercises but can be used to pre-download and cache required libraries and containers upfront and avoid stretching workshop internet connection to the maximum.

Run `mvn dependency:resolve`, `mvn dependency:resolve-plugins` and `docker-compose pull` to download everything that's required for the workshop
